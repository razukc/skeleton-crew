Skeleton Crew is a minimal, plugin-based application runtime for building internal tools and modular applications.

## What's New in v1.0

- Initial release of the runtime
- Basic plugin system
- Screen registry
- Action engine
- Event bus

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install skeleton-crew-runtime@1.0.0
```

## Core Concepts

### Runtime

The Runtime is the main orchestrator that initializes and coordinates all subsystems.

### Plugins

Plugins extend the runtime with custom functionality. Each plugin can:
- Register screens
- Define actions
- Listen to events

### Screens

Screens represent different views or pages in your application.

### Actions

Actions are executable operations that can be triggered by user interactions or other plugins.
